\fBDESCRIPTION\fP
.in +7
The fencing daemon, \fBfenced\fP, should be run on every node in a cluster
whose cluster membership is tracked in a distributed manner.  This is the
case when using a lock manager like the Distributed Locking Manager (DLM).
Locking managers, such as the Single Locking Manager (SLM) or Redundant
Locking Manager (RLM), track cluster membership centrally, and do not
require \fBfenced\fP to be running.
