\fBDESCRIPTION\fP
.in +7

This fencing agent is written for the Baytech RPC27-20nc in combination with
a Cyclades terminal server.  The Cyclades TS exports the RPC's serial port
via a Telnet interface.  Other interfaces, such as SSH, are possible.  
However, this script relys upon the assumption that Telnet is used.  Future
features to this agent would allow the agent to work with a mulitude of 
different communication protocols such as Telnet, SSH or Kermit.
.sp
The other assumption that is made is that Outlet names do not end in space.
The name "Foo" and "Foo    " are identical when the RPC prints them with
the status command.
.sp
fence_baytech accepts options on the command line as well as from stdin.
fenced sends parameters through stdin when it execs the agent.  fence_baytech
can be run by itself with command line options which is useful for testing.
