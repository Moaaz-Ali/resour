\fBDESCRIPTION\fP
.in +7
fence_ack_manual is run by an operator on the same node that fence_manual(8) 
was run after the operator has reset a node which required fencing.  A message 
in the system log indicates to the operator that they must reset a machine and 
then run fence_ack_manual.  Running fence_ack_manual allows the cluster to 
continue with recovery of the fenced machine.  The victim may be disconnected 
from storage rather than resetting it.
