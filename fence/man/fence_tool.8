.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfence_tool\fP is a program used to join or leave the default fence
domain.  It communicates with the fenced daemon.  Before telling fenced
to join the domain, fence_tool waits for the cluster to have quorum,
making it easier to cancel the command if the cluster is inquorate.

The dump option will read fenced's ring buffer of debug messages and print
it to stdout.
