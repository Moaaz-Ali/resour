.sp
\fB*** ATTENTION: fence_rib is deprecated.  fence_ilo should be used instead ***\fP
.sp
fence_rib is an I/O Fencing agent used for Compaq servers with the Remote Insight Light Out (RILOE) PCI card.  The agent creates an SSL tunnel from \fIlocalport\fR (default 8888) to the RILOE card.  The card has its own interface and is 
running on the default SSL port 443.  
.sp
fence_rib accepts options on the command line as well as from stdin.  
Fenced sends parameters through stdin when it execs the agent.  fence_rib 
can be run by itself with command line options.  This is useful for testing 
and for turning outlets on or off from scripts.

stunnel no longer works transparently for newer version of the iLO firmware, 
resulting in connections that are dropped too soon or data that is never delivered.
fence_ilo(8) should be used instead.
