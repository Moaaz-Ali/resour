\fBDESCRIPTION\fP
.in +7
fence_rackswitch is an I/O Fencing agent which can be used with the RackSaver 
RackSwitch.  It logs into the RackSwitch and boots a specified plug.
Using the http interface to the RackSwitch should be avoided while a GFS cluster is 
running because the connection may interfere with the operation of this agent.
.sp
fence_rackswitch accepts options on the command line as well as from stdin.  
fenced sends the options through stdin when it execs the agent.  fence_rackswitch 
can be run by itself with command line options which is useful for testing.
