\fBDESCRIPTION\fP
.in +7
fence_wti is an I/O Fencing agent which can be used with the WTI Network 
Power Switch (NPS).  It logs into an NPS via telnet and boots a specified plug.
Lengthy telnet connections to the NPS should be avoided while a GFS cluster is 
running because the connection will block any necessary fencing actions.
.sp
fence_wti accepts options on the command line as well as from stdin.  
fenced sends the options through stdin when it execs the agent.  fence_wti 
can be run by itself with command line options which is useful for testing.
