.SH NAME
fence_apc - I/O Fencing agent for APC MasterSwitch

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B 
fence_apc
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
fence_apc is an I/O Fencing agent which can be used with the APC MasterSwitch
network power switch.  It logs into a MasterSwitch via telnet and reboots
a specified outlet.  Lengthy telnet connections to the MasterSwitch should
be avoided while a GFS cluster is running because the connection will
block any necessary fencing actions.

fence_apc accepts options on the command line as well as from stdin.  
Fenced sends parameters through stdin when it execs the agent.  fence_apc 
can be run by itself with command line options.  This is useful for testing 
and for turning outlets on or off from scripts.
