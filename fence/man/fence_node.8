\fBDESCRIPTION\fP
.in +7
\fBfence_node\fP is a program which accumulates all the necessary information
for I/O fencing a particular node and then performs the fencing action by
issuing a call to the proper fencing agent.  \fBfence_node\fP gets the
necessary information from the Cluster Configuration System (CCS).  CCS must
be running and properly configured for \fBfence_node\fP to work properly.

Override the requirement that the cluster be quorate.  The
\f-c\fP option is required with the use of this option.

Normal fencing options are only allowed when a cluster is
quorate.  This option is used to force the reading of CCS
information regardless of the quorate state, and perform
the fence operation.
