\fBDESCRIPTION\fP
.in +7
fence_manual is run by fenced.  It creates a fifo and waits for 
its counter-part fence_ack_manual(8) to acknowledge that a failed node
has been reset.  fence_ack_manual(8) should only be run after the operator
has reset the faulty node.
.sp
Note:  fence_manual is provided for use during testing and evaluation
only.  Sites should not use fence_manual as the primary fencing method
on a production cluster.
