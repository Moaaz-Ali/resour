+	A cluster filesystem.
+
+	Allows a cluster of computers to simultaneously use a block device
+	that is shared between them (with FC, iSCSI, NBD, etc...).  GFS reads
+	and writes to the block device like a local filesystem, but also uses
+	a lock module to allow the computers coordinate their I/O so
+	filesystem consistency is maintained.  One of the nifty features of
+	GFS is perfect consistency -- changes made to the filesystem on one
+	machine show up immediately on all other machines in the cluster.
