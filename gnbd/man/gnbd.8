\fBDESCRIPTION\fP
.in +7
The GFS Network Block Device has two parts, the client (which includes the
\fBgnbd.ko\fP module and  \fBgnbd_import\fP, \fBgnbd_recvd\fP, and
\fBgnbd_monitor\fP programs) and the server
(which include the \fBgnbd_serv\fP, \fBgnbd_clusterd\fP, and \fBgnbd_export\fP
programs).  The GNBD server allows a computer
to export multiple block devices or files (GNBDs).  The GNBD client allows a
computer to import these GNBDs, and use them as if they were local block
devices.  The primary difference between GNBD and NBD (the network block
device distributed with the Linux kernel) is GNBD's ability to have multiple
clients all accessing the same served file or block device at the same
time.
