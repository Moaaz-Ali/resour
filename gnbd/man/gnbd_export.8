gnbd_export - the interface to export GNBDs

.in
\fBSYNOPSIS\fP 
.in +7
\fBgnbd_export\fP [options]
.sp
.in
\fBDESCRIPTION\fP
.in +7
gnbd_export exports local block devices or files as GNBDs.
.sp
.in
\fBOPTIONS\fP
.in +7
\fB-c\fP
.in +7
Enable caching.
.sp
Reads from the exported GNBD will take advantage of the linux page cache.
This option is used with \fB-e\fP. \fBNOTE:\fP This was the default
behavior for gnbd_export through GFS 5.2.  If this option is not specified,
gnbd will run with a noticeable performance decrease.  Also, if this option
is not specified, the exported GNBD will run in timeout mode, with the
default timeout (see the \fB-t\fP option).  Customers who have been GFS 5.2
or earlier and do not want to change their gnbd setup should specify this
option. \fBWARNING:\fP You must NOT specify this option if you wish to use
gnbd with pool multipathing.  To set up pool multipathing over gnbd, all
gnbds that are part of the pool must run with caching disabled.  Pool will
not check that this has been done correctly, and data corruption will occur
if the GNBD devices are run with caching.
.sp
.in
\fB-d\fI pathname\fR
.in +7
Device.
.sp
Specify the device to export as a GNBD.  This option is used with \fB-e\fP. 
\fIpathname\fR may be either a block device or a regular file.  Usually block 
devices are used, because this increases GNBD performance.
.sp
.in
\fB-e\fI gnbdname\fR
.in +7
Export.
.sp
Export a device as a GNBD with the Device name \fIgnbdname\fR. You must also
specify the pathname of the device with the \fB-d\fP option.  Once a GNBD 
has been exported, clients can import it with \fBgnbd_import\fP.
.sp
.in
\fB-h\fP
.in +7
Help.
.sp
Print the usage information.
.sp
.in
\fB-l\fP 
.in +7
List.
.sp
List all exported GNBDs and kgnbd_portd server information.  The listing 
contains each server's number (which is only for internal use), its Device 
name, the pathname of the device that is being exported, and the port that 
clients can use to access it.
.sp
.in
\fB-O\fP
.in +7
Override
.sp
This option allows you to unexport gnbd devices, even if they are still in
use.  When an agent other than fence_gnbd is used to fence gnbd client nodes,
occasionally gnbd server threads are not correctly cleaned up.  This causes
no performance issues. However, the affected gnbd devices cannot be unexported.
In this case, using the \fB-O\fP option with either \fB-r\fP or \fB-R\fP will
allow you to unexport the GNBD devices.  \fBWARNING:\fP Make sure
that no clients have the GNBD imported before using this option.
.sp
.in
\fB-p\fP [\fIport\fR]
.in +7
Start kgnbd_portd.
.sp
Start the kbgnbd_portd daemon (default port 14243). The kgnbd_portd daemon 
provides gndb_import with the information necessary to import the GNBDs.
If the daemon is started on a different port, the \fBgnbd_import\fP command 
must be run with the \fB-p\fP option.
.sp
.in
\fB-P\fP \fIport\fP
.in +7
GNBD Port
.sp
Specify the port to export a GNBD on.  This option is used with \fB-e\fP.
if \fB-P\fP isn't specified, an random port is chosen. The -P option is
necessary for autoreconnection with pool multipathing over gnbd. In order for
a gnbd client to autoreconnect to a server when pool tries to reintegrate
paths (see pool_mp(8) for details), the GNBD server must be at the same
IP and port as it was previously.
.sp

\fB-q\fP 
.in +7
Quiet.
.sp
Only prints out error messages.
.sp
.in
\fB-R\fP
.in +7
Remove All.
.sp
Remove all exported GNBDs.
.sp
.in
\fB-r\fP [\fIGNBD(s)\fR]
.in +7
Remove.
.sp
Remove named GNBD(s).
.sp
.in
\fB-s\fP
.in +7
Stop kgnbd_portd.
.sp
Stop the current kgnbd_portd daemon.  When the daemon is stopped, it will be
impossible for gnbd_import import the GNBDs. \fBNOTE:\fP This is not a
security feature.  It is still possible for someone who knows the port and
name of the GNBD to access it. This option mainly exists to allow the port
to be changed.
.sp
.in
\fB-t\fP [\fIseconds\fR]
.in +7
Timeout.
.sp
Set the exported GNBD to timeout mode  This option is used with \fB-p\fP.
This is the default for uncached GNBDs. For cached GNBDs, the default is wait
mode (For GFS versions up through 5.2, all GNBDs were in wait mode).  In wait
mode, if the connection to the server is lost, the gnbd client waits for the
connection to be reestablished, and then resends all the pending requests.  In
timeout mode, if the connection is lost or if the gnbd client does not receive a
response from the server within the timeout period, the gnbd client returns all
pending and future requests as failures until the imported GNBD is closed. The
default timeout period is 5 seconds. Timeout mode is necessary for failover to
work with pool multipathing over gnbd.
.sp
.in
\fB-v\fP
.in +7
Verbose.
.sp
Increase the verbosity of the output.  This option is the most useful with
\fB-l\fP.  If it is used along with \fB-l\fP, an extended list of information
on each exported device will be printed.
.sp

Print out version information.
