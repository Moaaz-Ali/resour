Logging in is the only tightly bound request/response action.
glvc> Hello <name>\n
glvd> HI\n


All the rest are fairly free form. Since the client is mostly just a
pass-through for stuff to gulm.

glvd sends:
 lock <key> <state> <flags> <lvb>\n
 action <key> <action> <lvb>\n
 cancel <key>\n
 dropexp <nodename> <mask>\n
 GOODBYE\n

glvc send:
 lrpl <key> <state> <flags> <error> <lvb>\n
 arpl <key> <action> <error>\n
 drop <key> <state>\n
 GOODBYE\n

<mask> is [a-zA-Z0-9_]
