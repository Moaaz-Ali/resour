  How To Install Askant
  ---------------------

o Build Dependencies
  - Python
  - libgfs2 (part of the Red Hat cluster suite as a static lib)

o Dependencies
  - Python
  - blktrace and blkparse with appropriate kernel config options enabled and
    debugfs mounted

o Intro
  Askant uses Python's distutils for its standard installation procedure so the
  setup.py script provides installation routines. Note that it doesn't provide
  uninstallation routines so the best way to install it is to obtain a package
  for your particular distribution and install that.

o Installation
  To install askant to the default location on your system, run as root:

    ./setup.py install

  If you wish to install it to a different root directory (e.g. /var/mychroot)
  or prefix directory (e.g. /usr/local instead of /usr) see:
  
    ./setup.py install --help

  To find out everything else setup.py can do:

    ./setup.py --help-commands

o Use Without Installing
  To use askant without installing it (e.g. if you want to test patches
  quickly) it is necessary to carry out the build stage to compile the required
  plugins. Do:

    ./setup.py build
    cd build/lib*
    python askant/askant.py
