0. FIX
	Clients are only made aware of a server failure if they need
	something from it.  So, if a server dies, some may see this
	and appoint a new master.  When the original server comes
	back, we can have a split - those who found a new master and
	those that haven't.

1. Basic code clean-up

2. Figure out how to best utilize dm-log.c code without duplication

3. Use mempool

4. Use hash for server-side region use tracking, as opposed to linked list

5. register the cluster_log service with cman at a level between
   SERVICE_LEVEL_GDLM and SERVICE_LEVEL_GFS.
	- this is not all that important right now, since we do
	not use the DLM.  So, recovery can happen in parallel with
	the DLM (before or after).  It must, however, happen after
	fence and before GFS, which is why SERVICE_LEVEL_GDLM was
	chosen.

6. Implement paranoid mode

7. Implement core mode

8. Unable to specify port numbers (unable to change the default)

9. the uuid scheme for identifying logs sucks

10. the _in_sync flag should be per log
