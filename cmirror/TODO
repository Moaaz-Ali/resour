HIGH PRIORITY  (data integrity related)
=============
DO NOT CONSIDER PRODUCTION READY UNTIL THESE BUGS ARE CLEARED.

1. Ensure that the proper blocks are being re-sync'ed upon node failure
	A) Just regions in use by client machines when they die.
	B) All regions in use when server dies.
	*) FIX IN PLACE: VERIFYING

2. Ensure that it is not possible to have a machine (client or server)
   die and lose important state.  An example might be:
	1) two machines have marked a region dirty (only marked once
		in the bitmap, server maintains info on the two machines)
	2) server dies
	3) new server designated, mirror region resync'ed
	4) machines continue to use region without server knowing region
	   should be in dirty state
	5) one of the original machines dies
	*) FIX IN PLACE: VERIFYING

MEDIUM PRIORITY (functionality related, but data not at risk)
===============
UNTIL THESE BUGS ARE CLEARED, CONSIDER PRODUCTION READY WITH THE
EXPECTATION THAT SOME FEATURES MAY BE SUBOPTIMAL OR NOT FULLY
FUCTIONAL.

1. cluster_dtr (or disk_dtr?) should write bits to disk if it is
   in charge of the log.  This must be done in such a way so that
   a new master does not pick up the disk before the leaving node
   has flushed it.


LOW PRIORITY (coding practice, extended functionality, etc)
============

1. Basic code clean-up

2. Figure out how to best utilize dm-log.c code without duplication

3. Use mempool  -DONE-

4. Use hash/tree for server-side region use tracking, as opposed to linked list

5. register the cluster_log service with cman at a level between
   SERVICE_LEVEL_GDLM and SERVICE_LEVEL_GFS.
	- this is not all that important right now, since we do
	not use the DLM.  So, recovery can happen in parallel with
	the DLM (before or after).  It must, however, happen after
	fence and before GFS, which is why SERVICE_LEVEL_GDLM was
	chosen.

6. Implement paranoid mode
	1) Requires changes to dm-raid1.c.  Specifically, it requires a
	   mark/clear region request to exist for reads as well as writes

7. Implement core mode

8. Unable to specify port numbers (unable to change the default, which is
   51006 for the cluster log server)

9. the uuid scheme for identifying logs sucks

10. cluster disk log is read by server when a node joins, leaves, or fails.
    We probably don't have to read it when a node joins.
