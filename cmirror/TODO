0. cluster_dtr (or disk_dtr?) should write bits to disk if it is
   in charge of the log.  This must be done in such a way so that
   a new master does not pick up the disk before the leaving node
   has flushed it.

1. Basic code clean-up

2. Figure out how to best utilize dm-log.c code without duplication

3. Use mempool

4. Use hash for server-side region use tracking, as opposed to linked list

5. register the cluster_log service with cman at a level between
   SERVICE_LEVEL_GDLM and SERVICE_LEVEL_GFS.
	- this is not all that important right now, since we do
	not use the DLM.  So, recovery can happen in parallel with
	the DLM (before or after).  It must, however, happen after
	fence and before GFS, which is why SERVICE_LEVEL_GDLM was
	chosen.

6. Implement paranoid mode

7. Implement core mode

8. Unable to specify port numbers (unable to change the default)

9. the uuid scheme for identifying logs sucks
