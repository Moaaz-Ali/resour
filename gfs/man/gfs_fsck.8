\fBDESCRIPTION\fP
.in +7
gfs_fsck will check that the GFS file system on a device is structurally valid.
It should not be run on a mounted file system.  If file system corruption is
detected, it will attempt to repair the file system.  There is a limit to what
gfs_fsck can do.  If important file system structures are destroyed, such that
the checker can not determine what the repairs should be, reparations could
fail.

GFS is a journaled file system, and as such should be able to repair damages to
the file system on its own.  However, faulty hardware has the ability to write
incomplete blocks to a file system thereby causing corruption that GFS can not
fix.  The first step to ensuring a healthy file system is the selection of
reliable hardware (i.e. storage systems that will write complete blocks - even
in the event of power failure).
