\fBDESCRIPTION\fP
.in +7
gfs_eattr is a program to access and modify extended attributes on gfs. 
Extended Attributes are \fBname\fP, \fBvalue\fP pairs that can be associated 
files on a gfs filesystem.  They can be used to store system data (to implement 
ACLs, for instance) or user data. gfs_eattr will create, remove, list, or
replace the value of an extended attribute for the \fIfile\fR specified with 
\fI-f\fR.

\fBOPTIONS\fP
.in +7
\fB-c\fP \fIeaname\fR
.in +7
Create.
.sp
Create a new extended attribute with name \fIea_name\fR. There are two types 
of extended attributes, user and system.  All user attribute names all start 
with \fBuser.\fP and all system attribute names start with \fBsystem.\fP. If 
the \fIeaname\fR does not contain \fBuser.\fP or \fBsystem.\fP, it is assumed 
to be a user attribute. 
Anyone with write access to the file can modify user attributes. Only the 
file's owner and the superuser can modify system attributes.  Anyone with 
read access to the file can get an attribute value.  \fBNOTE\fP This is 
different from how extended attributes are supposed to work under Linux.  They 
should have the same read permissions as regular attributes (anyone who can  
list the file, can read the attributes).  Unfortunately, until EAs are handled 
by a system call under Linux, this is not possible. 
Create will fail if 
the file has no more room for extended attributes (this varies by filesystem 
blocksize, but it is at least 29K, and it will always be possible to 
associate at least 61 extended attributes with a file, regardless of their 
size), if the name is longer than 255 characters, 
or if the value is too large.  (This also varies by filesystem blocksize.  For 
any blocksize greater than 512, the maximum value size is 65535 bytes. For 
filesystems with a blocksize of 512, the maximum value size varies with the 
name size, but it is always at least 13176 bytes, and never more than 28304 
bytes).  The Create option must also include a value.  To specify  a value, 
use either the \fB-o\fP or \fB-i\fP option.  If neither option is specified, 
the value is read from stdin.

.in +7
Get.
.sp
Get the value of an extended attribute. Like in Create, if \fIeaname\fR does 
not start with \fBuser.\fP or \fBsystem.\fP it is assumed to be a user
attribute. The \fB-n\fP option can be used with the get option to add a
newline character to the end of the output.

Help.
.sp
Print the usage information.
.sp
.in
\fB-i\fP \fIpathname\fR
.in +7
input file.
.sp
Read the value for the extended attribute from the file at \fIpathname\fR. 
This option is used with the \fB-c\fP, \fB-p\fP and \fB-s\fP options. To read 
from stdin,  use the pathname \fB-\fP. See the \fB-c\fP option for information 
on maximum value size. This option can not be used with \fB-o\fP.
.sp
.in
\fB-l\fP
.in +7
List.
.sp
List all extended attributes names for a file.  \fBNote\fP, In order to comply
with the system calls for extended attributes that are in the Linux 2.5 kernel,
the maximum list length is 64K.  If the list of names is longer than 64K, the
later names will not appear, although they can still be accessed.
.sp
.in
\fB-n\fP
.in +7
Newline.
.sp
Insert a newline at the end of the output from the \fB-g\fP option.
.sp
.in
\fB-o\fP \fIeavalue\fR
.in +7
Value.
.sp
use \fIeavalue\fR as the attribute value.  This is an alternative to using the 
\fB-i\fP option to specify the value.  It can be used with the \fB-c\fP,  
\fB-p\fP, and \fB-s\fP options.  See the \fB-c\fP option for information on the 
maximum size for values.
.sp
.in
\fB-p\fP \fIeaname\fR
.in +7
Replace.
.sp
Replace the value of the extended attribute \fIeaname\fR. For this option to 
succeed, an extended attribute with the name \fIeaname\fR must already exist. 
This option needs a new value to be specified. This can be done with either 
the \fB-i\fP option or the \fB-o\fP option. If neither option is used, the 
value will be read from stdin.
.sp
.in
\fB-r\fP \fIeaname\fR
.in +7
Remove.
.sp
Remove extended attribute.  Remove will fail if the attribute \fIeaname\fR 
doesn't exist.
.sp
.in
\fB-s\fP \fIeaname\fR
.in +7
Set.
.sp
Set the extended attribute. This option is equivalent to \fB-c\fP if 
\fIeaname\fR doesn't already exist, and equivalent to \fB-p\fP if it does.
