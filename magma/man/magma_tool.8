\fBDESCRIPTION\fP
.in +7
\fBmagma_tool\fP is part of the Magma cluster API abstraction library.
Its primary purpose is for API debugging and tweaking; it does not control
anything and has no configuration information to speak of.

\fBPLUGIN COMMANDS\fP
.in +7
\fBlist\fP
.in +7
This command is used to list plugins and other files in Magma's plugin
directory and whether or not they are legal plugins.  This will list all
non-directory files in Magma's plugin directory, whether or not they are
legal plugins, and why.

.sp
.in
\fBenable\fP \fI<filename>\fP
.in +7
This command is used to enable a plugin in Magma's plugin directory.
It is synonymous with "chmod u+r <filename>".  Files without in the
plugin directory without the user-readable bit set (S_IRUSR) are ignored.

.sp
.in
\fBdisable\fP \fI<filename>\fP
.in +7
This command is used to disable a plugin in Magma's plugin directory.
It is synonymous with "chmod u+r <filename>".  Files without in the
plugin directory without the user-readable bit set (S_IRUSR) are ignored.

\fBAPI TEST COMMANDS\fP
.in +7
These commands may all be preceded by the option \fIlogin\fP.  If specified,
magma_tool will log in to the service/node group on cluster infrastructures
where this notion is supported.

.sp
\fBlock\fP \fI[resource]\fP
.in +7
This causes magma_tool to connect to the underlying cluster infrastructure
and/or lock manager and acquire a clusterlock.  If \fI[resource]\fP is not
specified, then the name "Something" is used.

.sp
.in
\fBlisten\fP \fI[group]\fP
.in +7
This causes magma_tool to connect to the underlying cluster infrastructure
and/or lock manager and listen for events in the group \fI[group]\fP.  This
is only useful with the \fIlogin\fP flag.

.sp
.in
\fBlocalname\fP \fI[group]\fP
.in +7
This causes magma_tool to connect to the underlying cluster infrastructure
and/or lock manager and request the local node name, which it then displays.

.sp
.in
\fBlocalid\fP \fI[group]\fP
.in +7
This causes magma_tool to connect to the underlying cluster infrastructure
and/or lock manager and request the local node ID, which it then displays.

.sp
.in
\fBmembers\fP \fI[group]\fP
.in +7
This causes magma_tool to connect to the underlying cluster infrastructure
and/or lock manager and request the list of members, which it then displays.
If \fI[group]\fP is specified, then only the members of the given service
or node group are listed.

.sp
.in
\fBquorum\fP \fI[group]\fP
.in +7
This causes magma_tool to connect to the underlying cluster infrastructure
and/or lock manager and request the local node's quorum status as well as
whether or not it is a member of \fI[group]\fP.


.sp
.in
\fBconfig\fP \fI<item>\fP
.in +7
This displays compile-time information; see below.

.in -7
\fBCONFIGURATION\fP
.in +7
\fBconfig cflags\fP
.in +7
Displays the compiler flags needed to build applications against Magma.

.sp
.in
\fBconfig libs\fP
.in +7
Displays the compiler linker flags needed to build applications against
Magma.

.sp
.in
\fBconfig libs-nt\fP
.in +7
Displays the compiler linker flags needed to build applications against
Magma's lightweight, mostly-reentrant library..

.sp
.in
\fBconfig plugindir\fP
.in +7
Displays directory Magma uses for plugins.

.sp
.in
\fBconfig libdir\fP
.in +7
Displays where Magma's dynamic libraries reside.

.sp
.in
\fBconfig slibdir\fP
.in +7
Displays where Magma's static libraries reside.
