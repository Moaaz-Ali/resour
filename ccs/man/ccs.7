ccs - Cluster Configuration System

.in
\fBDESCRIPTION\fP
.in +7
A cluster environment that shares resources has information that is
essential to correct operation which must be available to
every node in the cluster.  This information may include:
names of the nodes composing the cluster, I/O fencing methods, and
more.  \fICCS\fP is the system that makes it possible for the nodes in a
cluster to retrieve the information they need.

\fBOVERVIEW\fP
.in +7
The following is a generic description of the steps one should take to produce
a working CCS environment.

\fBStep 1)\fP
.sp
Choose a cluster name.  It is important to determine
a name for the cluster before starting.  The cluster name is what
binds a machine to specific resources that can only be shared by
machines that are members of the same cluster name.

\fBStep 2)\fP
.sp
Create the directory \fI/etc/cluster\fP.

\fBStep 3)\fP
.sp
Create the \fI/etc/cluster/cluster.conf\fP file, according to the
\fBcluster.conf(5)\fP man page, on one node in your cluster.

\fBStep 4)\fP
.sp
Start \fBccsd\fP and test the cluster.conf file by using \fBccs_test\fP.
If you haven't started a cluster manager yet, you should use the 'force'
option to \fBccs_test\fP - see the \fBccs_test(8)\fP man page for more info.

If a failure occurs while parsing the config file, \fBccs_test\fP should
report "ccs_connect failed: No data available" and /var/log/messages
should report "Unable to parse /etc/cluster/cluster.conf".
