ccsd - The daemon used to access CCS cluster configuration files.

\fBDESCRIPTION\fP
.in +7
\fBccsd\fP is part of the Cluster Configuration System (CCS).  It is the
daemon which accesses cluster the configuration file for other cluster
applications.  It must be run on each node that wishes to join a cluster.

\fBOPTIONS\fP
.in +7

\fB-4\fP
.in +7
Use IPv4 for all communication.  By default, IPv6 is tried, then IPv4.
.sp
.in

\fB-6\fP
.in +7
Use IPv6 for all communication.  By default, IPv6 is tried, then IPv4.
.sp
.in

\fB-h\fP
.in +7
Help.  Print out the usage syntax.
.sp
.in

\fB-m <multicast address>\fP
.in +7
Used to specify the multicast address.  The keyword "default" can be used,
in which case "ff02::3:1" is used for IPv6 and "224.0.2.5" is used for IPv4.

If you are using IPv4, the default action is to use broadcast.  Specifying
this option will cause multicast to be used in that instance.

\fB-n\fP

No daemon.  Run in the foreground.

\fB-P <port identifier>:<port number>\fP
.in +7
You have the option of specifying the port numbers used by ccsd.  The port
identifier is either: b, c, or f.  "b" is the port which ccsd attempts to
communicate with ccsd processes on other machines, via broadcast/multicast, to
obtain or validate its config file (cluster.conf).  This is known as the backend
port.  "c" is the base port number of two consecutive ports used by ccsd
processes to communicate cluster membership information.  This is known as the
cluster base port.  "f" is the port number that listens for information requests
from the CCS library (or programs using it).  This is known as the frontend port.

So, to change the frontend port one might specify \fI-P f:60000\fP.
