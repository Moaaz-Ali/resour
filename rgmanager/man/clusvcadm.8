.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
The
.B clusvcadm
command allows an administrator to enable, disable, relocate, and restart
user services in a cluster.  In order to perform cluster service operations,
the cluster daemons must be running (and have quorum) on the member system
on which the command is invoked.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP "\-d <service>"
Stops and disables the user service named
.I
service
.IP "\-e <service>"
Enables and starts the user service named
.I
service
.IP \-l
Lock the local resource group manager.  This should only be used if the 
administrator intends to perform a global, cluster-wide shutdown.  This
prevents starting resource groups on the local node, allowing 
services will not fail over during the shutdown of the cluster.  Generally,
administrators should use the
.B
clushutdown(8)
command to accomplish this.  Once the cluster quorum is dissolved, this
state is reset.
.IP "\-m <member>"
When used in conjunction with either the
.B
\-e
or
.B
\-r
options, this specifies the 
.I
preferred
target member on which to start the 
service.
.IP "\-r <service>"
Relocates the user service named
.I
service
to another cluster member.
.IP "\-R <service>"
Restarts the user service named
.I
service
on the cluster member on which it is currently running.
.IP "\-S"
Display whether each of the active service managers is locked or not.  This
can be used to verify the correct operation of the \fB-l\fR and \fB-u\fR 
options, but is only useful for debugging.
.IP "\-s <service>"
Stops the service named
.I
service
until a member transition or until it is enabled again.
.IP \-u
Unlock the cluster's service managers.  This allows services to transition
again.  It will be necessary to re-enable all services in the stopped state
if this is run after \fB clushutdown(8)\fR.

.IP \-v
Display version information and exit.
