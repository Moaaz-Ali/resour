	* include/resgroup.h: Add a default check interval.
	* include/reslist.h: Add a recover operation, and put operations
	and checks together in each instantiated resource structure.
	* src/daemons/groups.c: Don't use the old rg_status() func --
	its internals have changed.
	* src/daemons/reslist.c: Duplicate the action structure of a 
	parent resource type into an instantiated resource.
	* src/daemons/resrules.c: Find the actions with the correct
	path.
	* src/daemons/restree.c: Add depth parameter to res_exec.  Add
	do_status - find the highest check/status level to perform given
	the elapsed time since another status operation was performed.
	Add a reference count each time a resource is started on a node.
	* src/daemons/rg_thread.c: Implement periodic status checks. 
 	Currently (in contrast to clumanager 1.2), these status checks
	are automatic and not configurable.
	* src/resources/*: Misc updates re: check intervals, new 
	parameters, etc.

	* src/resources/group.sh: Add 'autostart' parameter to group 
	entity
	* src/daemons/*: Add support for OCF 'action' specifications.

	* src/resources/*: Add status/monitor actions to metadata
	* include/list.h: Update to fix compiler warnings.  This is not
	complete; it's better to add a 'field' to structures requiring 
	list specs.
	* src/clulib/vft.c: Remove unnecessary pthread locks.
	* src/daemons/*: Misc. code cleanups.

	* global: prepare for RPM build
