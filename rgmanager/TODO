* Not currently tested with GuLM.

* Online configuration changes don't work yet (at all).
  - Need a way for CCS to notify clients of a configuration change
  - Still working out with visegrips.

* Too much RAM allocated. ;)  Silly pthreads.
  - Need to check out how much stack size we actually need.  Obviously,
    resource group threads need the most of any due to recursion and
    the whole arbitrarily complex tree structure of resource groups.

* I suspect View-Formation is not scalable more than about 32 nodes
the way it's currently implemented.
  - Another implementation would be to only keep track of pieces of data
    relevant to resource groups running on each node and update a
    centralized server.  This is more scalable, but requires more recovery
    in the event that the centralized server fails.  Centralized server
    can simply be high-node-ID or low-node-ID of the current active
    membership.

* No man pages.

* Init script 100% broken.
  - Ok, all we need to do is start clurgmgrd and stop it.

* Write RHEL 3 -> LCP upgrade.
  - Should be simple; the resource group structure is based on the RHEL3
    cluster manager model.
