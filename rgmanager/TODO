* Not currently tested with GuLM.

* Online configuration works, but needs SIGHUP from either ccsd or
  a ccsd-called-program

* I suspect View-Formation is not scalable more than about 32 nodes
the way it's currently implemented.
  - Another implementation would be to only keep track of pieces of data
    relevant to resource groups running on each node and update a
    centralized server.  This is more scalable, but requires more recovery
    in the event that the centralized server fails.  Centralized server
    can simply be high-node-ID or low-node-ID of the current active
    membership.

* No man pages.

* Init script 100% broken.
  - Ok, all we need to do is start clurgmgrd and stop it.

* Write RHEL 3 -> LCP upgrade.
  - Should be simple; the resource group structure is based on the RHEL3
    cluster manager model.
