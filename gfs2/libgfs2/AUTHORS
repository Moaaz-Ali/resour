The routines for gfslib2 were written by a bunch of people at Sistina
and Red Hat, Inc. for the Red Hat Cluster Suite.

Before gfslib2, each of the GFS utilities (gfs_fsck, gfs_edit, gfs_mkfs, etc)
used their own routines for doing disk IO without the GFS module and
cluster suite framework.  

The original prototype for libgfs2 came from mkfs, written by Steve
Whitehouse (swhiteho@redhat.com)

The guy who actually bundled the routines together into gfslib2 
using libtool and automake was Bob Peterson (rpeterso@redhat.com)
