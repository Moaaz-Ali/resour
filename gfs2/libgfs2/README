libgfs2
-------
The libgfs2 library is part of the gfs2_utils package for doing userland
manipulation on gfs2 filesystems.

It is designed to allow the gfs2 userland tools (i.e. gfs2_mkfs, gfs2_fsck,
etc.) to use a common set of functions to manipulate the internal
structures of a gfs2 filesystem.

You can build libgfs2 into a static library (libgfs2.a) or dynamic
library (libgfs2.so.0) by uncommenting the proper section in Makefile.am
before building.

The original routines were written by Steve Whitehouse and others at
Sistina and Red Hat.  The library was originally morphed from the mkfs tool.
